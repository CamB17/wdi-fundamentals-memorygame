Eames is an essential part of the secrecy and deceit within the dream world. Eames can project the image of anyone, essentially forging an identity as a literal physical manifestation. Combined with his ability to mirror other people's mannerisms and behaviors, he is a very capable doppelganger. This skill comes in handy, and can help convince another person that whomever team needs him to be in order to aid their deception. He frequently uses a Heckler and Koch P2000 throughout the first level defending the taxi and city warehouse from projections, a South African MGL grenade launcher and a SIG SG 552 assault rifle with custom arctic camouflage while planting charges in the hospital. He is portrayed by actor Tom Hardy. He is also seen holding a Beretta 92FS Inox in the poster. Eames' totem is a poker chip.
